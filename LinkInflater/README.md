# Link Inflater

### An open-source Chrome extension for expanding shortened URLs.

Utilizes the [Link Inflater](https://linkinflater.herokuapp.com) to expand
shortened URLs. This is useful for when you encounter shortened URLs, but
you're not sure where the URL is going to take you to. 

The extension is a simple context menu that is created when the user right-clicks
on selected text, or a hyperlink in Chrome. When the user clicks on the context
menu item that is created, the extension goes out to the Link Inflater API and
requests the expanded URL. The expanded url is then displayed to the user in a 
JavaScript prompt window.

***

The extension source code is available for the community to make improvements
to, and I am always looking for people to add value to the tools that we share
as a community. If you have suggestions, or improvements that you'd like to see
in the extension, pleaes clone the repository and submit a pull request. I am very
responsive in getting back to people.
